## Title
Recommending Add-ons for items in Myntra cart

## Purpose

This project was created for Phase 2: Implementation of [Myntra HackerRamp: Campus Edition 2021](https://dare2compete.com/competition/myntra-hackerramp-campus-edition-2021-myntra-201010)



## Description
Frequently bought together items is a widely used recommendation engine that shows the users what items were bought with a particular purchased item.

The recommendation is usually the top most purchased together permutation.  This is often seen at the time of purchase to encourage a user to increase their cart value.

We used the Itertools library in Python and visualized this in Power BI
